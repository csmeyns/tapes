**Theme: The Great Kantō Earthquake and Massacre**   
29 December 2023  
9.30 PM WAT/CET  
Duration: ca. 79 minutes  
Watch party: https://stream.provo.lol

It's a hundred years this year since the [Great Kantō earthquake of 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_Great_Kant%C5%8D_earthquake) shook the Kantō region in Japan. 

It's also a hundred years since, in the earthquake's aftermath, people in the region committed the [Kantō Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_Massacre). During the massacre, vigilantes---spurred on by rumours, racist hatred, and aided by police and government authorities---murdered an estimated 6,000 people of Korean descent, as well as non-Korean Japanese communists, socialists, and anarchists.

In tonight's screening, you'll get archival footage from the destruction at the time, and will be ableto do some digging into historical awareness and responsibility around the massacre.
