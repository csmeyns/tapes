heeeyy for our official launch of Tapes @ Provo.lol we'll be screening the fresh full movie animation *Ambient Trip Commander* (2022, The Netherlands) directed by the greatest living artist on earth---Danny Wolfers a.k.a. [Legowelt](http://legowelt.org).

Here's the official description:

> AMBIENT TRIP COMMANDER is the story of Samantha Tapfersten, a geeky young woman who lives a rather dull life in a medium-sized European city. She works a mundane job at a synthesizer store and spends her lonely evenings playing RPG games. One day she receives a cryptic email from a hacker group inviting her to Lonetal, a village secluded somewhere deep in the European Alps. As we follow her journey to Lonetal, things become more sinister and a grand mystery starts to unfold…

> AMBIENT TRIP COMMANDER is the first feature animation film made by Danny Wolfers aka Legowelt. The animation, in which Wolfers’ paintings come to life, is hand drawn, frame-by-frame, using vibrant watercolors and is the achievement of a laborious process which took 18 months to accomplish.

> With a running time of 70 minutes, AMBIENT TRIP COMMANDER presents a full original soundtrack made by Wolfers himself (...). AMBIENT TRIP COMMANDER offers a profound and visually stimulating voyage into Wolfers’ intriguing – and at times, uncanny – fictive world through animation and sound.

Of course you *could* already go off and watch it right now, but ... why? Join us on Friday at the watch party :D
