      <description>We had planned to screen three pieces of Palestinian cinema tonight. However, it&amp;rsquo;s emerged that Israel has destroyed all phone and internet connections in Gaza, causing a full communication blackout. This is atrocious. Cutting communication will leave people in Palestine with even fewer options to report on their situation and the war crimes that Israel is committing to the rest of the world.
As such, your dutiful provolol admin team decided that instead of running our pre-planned programme, they&amp;rsquo;ll go out onto the street tonight and join a protest.</description>
